CSC 471: Principles of Database Systems

Fall 2019

The "dir" folder in this directory contains the files needed to run the University Database Application on a web browser. Most of these files where generated automatically upon creating a new web application from CodeIgniter. The version of CodeIgniter used here comes from Ampps. The code for this application was mainly written in HTML and PHP.

The directory that contains most of the code that I wrote is:

dir/application/views/pages
